							<h2>2. Data Preparation</h2>
							<li>Convert dataset in to table</li>

							<h2>3. Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>

							<li>Calculate the total number of employees with active status each year</li><br>
							<img src="images/project-03/3.1.1.employee-active.png" alt="" height="200" /><br><br>
							<img src="images/project-03/3.1.2.grafik-employee-active.png" alt="" height="300" /><br><br>
							<p>Based on the graph of the number of employees with active status, the number of employees continued to increase 
								from 2011 to 2013. However, there was a decrease in the number of employees in 2014 and 2015</p>

							<li>Calculate the number of terminated employees each year</li><br>
							<img src="images/project-03/3.2.1.employee-terminated.png" alt="" height="200" /><br><br>
							<img src="images/project-03/3.2.2.employee-terminated.png" alt="" height="300" /><br><br>
							<p>The number of terminated employees in 2014 and 2015 was the highest compared to previous years. That is likely the
								 cause of the decrease in the number of employees in 2014 and 2015.</p>

							<li>Ratio of termination employees each year</li><br>
							<img src="images/project-03/3.3.1.ratio-terminated.png" alt="" height="200" /><br><br>
							<img src="images/project-03/3.3.2.ratio-terminated.png" alt="" height="300" /><br><br>
							<p>If calculated based on the ratio, then 2014 is the largest ratio for terminated employees (4.9%). Meanwhile, 2013 was 
								the year with the smallest terminated ratio at 2%. The same year, 2013, had the largest number of employees in the company.</p>

							<li>Business unit with the highest number of terminations each year</li><br>
							<img src="images/project-03/3.4.1.ratio-terminated-unit-bisnis.png" alt="" height="200" /><br><br>
							<img src="images/project-03/3.4.2.ratio-terminated-unit-bisnis.png" alt="" height="300" /><br><br>
							<p>If calculating based on the number of terminated employees, the store business unit has the most terminated employees, which is
								 95% of the total terminated employees. While 5% comes from the Head Office. However, if you look at the ratio of terminated
								 employees, it is the head office that is higher at 11.8% and the store with a ratio of 2.9%</p>

							<li>Departments with the smallest and largest number of terminations</li><br>
							<img src="images/project-03/3.5.1.ratio-terminated-department.png" alt="" height="300" /><br><br>
							<img src="images/project-03/3.5.2.ratio-terminated-department.png" alt="" height="300" /><br><br>
							<img src="images/project-03/3.5.3.ratio-terminated-department.png" alt="" height="300" /><br><br>
							<p>The Meats department has the highest total terminated employees of 377 employees then the produce department of 353 and the
								 customer service department of 262. However, these departments have a relatively small terminated ratio, namely the Meats
								 department (3.7%), the Produce department (4.1%) and the Customer Service department (3.7%). The largest terminated ratio
								 is found in the Information Technology department, which is 25%.</p>

							<li>Average age of employees per department</li><br>
							<img src="images/project-03/3.6.1.age-active.png" alt="" height="400" /><br><br>
							<p>The average age for employees with active status is 42 years old with the highest average age in the HR Technology department
								 at 60 years old and the lowest in the Customer Service department at 32 years old.</p>

							<li>Average age of employees with termination status</li><br>
							<img src="images/project-03/3.7.1.age-terminated.png" alt="" height="400" /><br><br>
							<p>The average age for employees with terminated status is 51 years old with the highest average age in the Accounting department
								 at 65 years old and the lowest in the Customer Service department at 28 years old.</p>
							<img src="images/project-03/3.7.2.age-terminated.png" alt="" height="300" /><br><br>
							<p>The average age of employees with active status is lower than the average age of employees with terminated status except for 
								Executives who have no history of termination from the beginning until 2015 and Customer Service whose average age of active
								employees is higher than employees with terminated status.</p>

							<li>Reasons for termination</li><br>
							<img src="images/project-03/3.8.1.reason-terminated.png" alt="" height="200" /><br><br>
							<img src="images/project-03/3.8.2.reason-terminated.png" alt="" height="300" /><br><br>
							<p>Based on the annual trend, the drastic decline in the number of employees in 2014 and 2015 was caused by layoffs of 142 employees
								 in 2014 and 73 employees in 2015. Layoffs only occurred in that year, throughout the history of employee data in this company.</p>
							<img src="images/project-03/3.8.3.reason-terminated.png" alt="" height="300" /><br><br>
							<p>Retirement is the largest for employees with terminated status at 60%, then Resignaton at 26% and Layoff at 14%.</p>

							<li>Average length of service of terminated employees</li><br>
							<img src="images/project-03/3.9.1.masa-kerja-terminated.png" alt="" height="400" /><br><br>
							<img src="images/project-03/3.9.2.masa-kerja-terminated.png" alt="" height="300" /><br><br>
							<p>Based on the matrix above, it is known that most employees are retired with a service period between 5-10 years (21.9%) and above
								 10 years (78.1%). As for the most resignaton employees with a service period of 1-5 years and the most layoff employees with
								 a service period of > 10 years (49.1%).</p>

							<br>
							<h2>4. Conclusion</h2>
							<p>Based on the analysis of employee termination data, it is known that there is a trend of employee growth from 2011 to 2013. However,
								 in 2014 and 2015 the number of employees continued to decline. This happened because the company carried out a layoff policy in 2014
								 (142 employees) or around 2.9% of total employees and 2015 (73 employees) or 1.5% of total employees in that year. This layoff policy
								 is also mostly imposed on employees with more than 10 years of service with an average age of 51 years, where in the Customer Service
								 division the average age is 28 years and in Accounting the average age is 65 years. In addition, the number of employees who are most
								 often terminated are employees from the Store business unit, namely in the Meats, Produce and Customer Service departments.</p>
